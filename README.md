# Objedname task

## Steps of work

### 1. Understanding legacy code without starting

It was impossible to find missing instances like StoreManager or CashAPI. I decided that I will just go through the code and try to understand it.

### 2. Copying parts of code and adding types

Date utils are very useful in the current codebase. Rest of the code had to be rewrited.

### 3. Adding styling and animations

### 4. Adding logic and adjusting utils

### 5. Implementing mocked data fetching

## Next steps

### - Adding real functionalities

I'm am 100% sure that the final result of this task should be different. Probably I'm missing a lot features, but I wanted to spend on this around 2h. Next steps would be to add functionalities to navbar and events on calendar. I have also seen in the codebase that there is some deliveries logic, but I didn't understand how it was suppost to work.

### - Remove magical numbers

### - Adjust mobile version

### - Replace date utils to library for managing dates
